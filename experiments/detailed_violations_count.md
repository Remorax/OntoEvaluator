# Comparing OOPS! with SynEvaluator

This document seeks to compare OOPS! with SynEvaluator by comparing the number of violations reported by each of them for each of the pitfalls mentioned in the [OOPS! catalogue](http://oops.linkeddata.es/catalogue.jsp). The pitfalls are encoded by their IDs. `-` indicates a pitfall that has not been implemented by the corresponding tool. `ontology*` indicates violations present in the ontology as a whole, instead of in a specific element.
